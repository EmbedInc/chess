test_chpos <filename>

Test the chess move generator and coverage checker.  A chess board
position is read from the input file.  All possible moves and the
squares covered are shown for both sides.

The input file contains a chess position as sortof a "picture" of the
board position.  The first 8 lines of the file must contain 8 tokens
each, separated by spaces.  Additional lines are ignored.  Each token
specifies the contents of one chess square.  The "picture" is from
white's point of view.  The lines therefore represent the rows from
black's back row to white's back row.  The tokens accross each line are
for the squares of that row from white's left to white's right.  The
file is case-insensitive.

The allowable tokens are:

  BP  -  black pawn
  B2  -  black pawn, just jumped 2 last move
  BR  -  black rook
  BN  -  black knight
  BB  -  black bishop
  BQ  -  black queen
  BK  -  black king

  WP  -  white pawn
  W2  -  white pawn, just jumped 2 last move
  WR  -  white rook
  WN  -  white knight
  WB  -  white bishop
  WQ  -  white queen
  WK  -  white king

  OR  -  piece in its original position.

  --  -  empty square

Unless OR is used, it will be assumed the piece has been moved at least
once since the start of the game.  This will effect whether castleing
is allowed.

The B2 and W2 tokens are used to distinguish pawns that just jumped two
spaces forward in the previous move.  This will effect whether the
opponent may use the en-passant move to capture the pawn.

As an example, the starting position would look like this, except that
the tokens for all non-empty squares should be replaced by OR since all
pieces are in their original position.
